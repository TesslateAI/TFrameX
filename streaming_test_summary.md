- **Status**: MCP integration works seamlessly with streaming

### ✅ End-to-End Performance Comparison - COMPLETED
- **Performance Winner**: Mixed results with slight edge to streaming
- **Key Findings**:
  - Basic response time: Non-streaming faster (0.80s vs 1.39s avg)
  - Complex workflows: Streaming faster (8.59s vs 10.57s)
  - Parallel processing: Streaming faster (4.62s vs 8.70s)
  - Tool usage: Non-streaming faster (2.29s vs 3.67s)
  - Router patterns: Streaming faster (3.05s vs 4.28s)

## Performance Analysis

### Streaming Advantages
1. **Complex Workflows**: 23% faster for multi-step sequential processes
