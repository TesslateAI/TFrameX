## UI/UX Design

### Layout
1. **Header**
   - Logo (top-left)
   - Navigation bar (Home, About, Services, Booking, Contact)
   - CTA button (e.g., "Book Now" or "Learn More")

2. **Hero Section**
   - Large background image of a happy dog
   - Overlay text: "Welcome to [Daycare Name] – Where Your Pup Thrives!"
   - Subtext: "Safe, fun, and loving care for your furry friend"
   - CTA button: "Book a Spot"

3. **Services Section**
   - 3-4 cards with icons and short descriptions (e.g., "Daily Playtime", "Grooming", "Training")

4. **Testimonials**
   - User reviews with client photos (placeholder images)

5. **Contact Section**
   - Form for email, name, and message
   - Contact info (phone, address, social links)

6. **Footer**
   - Links (Privacy Policy, Terms)
   - Copyright notice

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use bold, playful fonts for headings (e.g., "Comic Sans MS" or "Great Vibes")
- Soft pastel colors (e.g., light blue, yellow, pink)
- Rounded corners for buttons/cards

---

## Assets
- **Images**: 
  - 3-4 high-quality dog photos (replace placeholders)
  - Logo (custom or placeholder)
- **Icons**: 
  - Simple line icons for services (e.g., play, groom, training)
- **Fonts**: 
  - Google Fonts (e.g., "Poppins" for body, "Great Vibes" for headings)
- **Favicon**: 
  - 16x16/32x32px icon (e.g., a paw print)

---

## Content
### Homepage
- **Headline**: "Welcome to [Daycare Name] – Where Your Pup Thrives!"
- **Subheadline**: "Safe, fun, and loving care for your furry friend"
- **Services**:
  - "Daily Playtime": "Active games and socialization with other dogs"
  - "Grooming": "Professional baths and nail trimming"
  - "Training": "Basic obedience and behavior classes"
- **Testimonials**:
  - "Amazing place! My dog loves it!" – Jane D.
  - "Friendly staff and clean facilities." – Mark T.
- **Contact Form**:
  - Fields: Name, Email, Message
  - Submit button: "Send Message"

---

## Frameworks
- **HTML5**: For structure
- **CSS3**: For styling (including `@media` queries for responsiveness)
- **JavaScript**: For form validation and interactivity (e.g., smooth scrolling)
- **No external libraries**: Use vanilla JS and CSS only

---

## Caveats
1. **Form Functionality**: 
   - The contact form requires a backend (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms) to work. Without it, submissions will not be processed.
2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure all elements scale properly on mobile devices (test with `@media` queries).
3. **Accessibility**:
   - Add `alt` text to images and semantic HTML (e.g., `<nav>`, `<section>`).
4. **Performance**:
   - Optimize images (e.g., compress PNGs/JPGs) to reduce load time.
5. **Customization**:
   - Replace placeholder text/images with actual content and branding.
6. **Hosting**:
   - Use services like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel for deployment.
